Newsflash: You don’t need a castle, a Sommelier on payroll, or a vault guarded by dragons to have a wine cellar. If you’ve got a closet, a basement, or even a corner you’re not using — congratulations, you can build one. Here’s how to start aging wine like a pro without torching your savings account.

## 1) Pick Your Spot (No, Not Next to the Oven)
Wine hates heat. So unless you want your $30 Bordeaux tasting like vinegar, keep it away from kitchens and sunny windows. Basements = great. Closets = decent. Garage = only if you hate wine.

## 2) Control Temperature and Humidity
Ideal: 55°F, 60–70% humidity. Translation: not your attic. You don’t need a $10k climate system — a $200 wine fridge does the job.

## 3) Racks, Racks, Racks
Forget stacking bottles on the floor like college beer. A cheap wooden or metal rack keeps bottles horizontal (keeps corks moist, avoids wine-scented sadness).

## 4) Starter Wines That Age Well
Don’t stash $8 Barefoot Merlot and expect it to age like fine Burgundy. Instead, go for:
- Bordeaux blends ($30+)
- Spanish Rioja Reserva
- Napa Cab under $40
- Italian Barolo (if you splurge)

## 5) Mistakes to Avoid
- Storing wine upright (your cork will dry out like the Sahara).
- Forgetting labels (you *will* open that 2030 bottle next week).
- Overbuying too fast. Build slowly.

## 6) Budget-Friendly Build
- Wine fridge: $300
- Racks: $100
- Starter bottles: $500  
  **Total: ~$900** for a small but mighty cellar.
