Some people invest in stocks. Others hoard crypto. Then there are the sophisticated few who invest in… fermented grape juice. And honestly? They’re not wrong. Wine can be both delicious and profitable, which is more than I can say for Dogecoin. Here’s the 101 guide to turning bottles into assets.

## Why Wine Is an Investment
It ages, supply shrinks, and demand goes up. Scarcity + patience = price appreciation. The only risk? You drink your retirement fund at 2am.

## Regions That Hold Value
- **Bordeaux:** French royalty of investment wine.
- **Burgundy:** Limited production, cult following, wild resale value.
- **Napa Valley:** America’s pride and joy, global demand still climbing.
- **Tuscany:** Affordable pathway into Italian blue chips.

## What to Look For
- Critic scores (Parker, Decanter)
- Vintage reports
- Producer reputation
  Translation: avoid the $7 “aged in a plastic bag” special.

## Risks Nobody Talks About
- Storage costs (wine doesn’t love your garage)
- Market swings (even grapes have bad seasons)
- Temptation to “rebalance” your portfolio into a glass

## Tools to Start
- **Wine-Searcher:** Price history & comps
- **Vinovest / Cult Wines:** Managed wine investing
- **Spreadsheet:** If you enjoy pain (and control)

**Want a shortcut?** Grab the Wine Investment Checklist and start building a portfolio you can toast to.
